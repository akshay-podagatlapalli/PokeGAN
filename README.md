# PokeGAN - A Generative Adversarial Network to Create New Pokemon

## Project Description and Motivation
After thinking long and hard (a quick google search) for new ML project ideas, I found the use of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) 
to be the most coolest and the one with a greater freedom of degree in what I could do. Specifically, I wanted to generate new Pokemon with 
this model. While there are earlier iterations on this project that I have taken inspiration from, such as [this](https://blog.jovian.ai/pokegan-generating-fake-pokemon-with-a-generative-adversarial-network-f540db81548d)  
and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shunsukeozeki/pokemon-dcgan-with-pytorch-create-new-pokemon), my goal with this project was to learn more about GANs
rather than generate new Pokemon. My expectations about this project was not necessarily results oriented at the start and any meaningful synthesis 
of new Pokemon was treated as a welcomed surprise since fine-tuning a GAN is rather tricky.    

## Data Used
